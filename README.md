 **📌 Recipe Management App**  

## **🔹 Overview**  
The **Recipe Management App** is a **full-stack web application** that enables users to **create, organize, and manage their recipes efficiently**. Designed for a seamless experience, the application provides a user-friendly interface with **dynamic and responsive UI** for smooth navigation.  

This project follows a **modular and scalable architecture**, separating frontend and backend concerns for better maintainability and performance. The core functionalities include:  
✅ **Adding, updating, and deleting recipes**  
✅ **Categorizing recipes by meal type** (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, etc.)  
✅ **Searching recipes by name or category**  
✅ **Intuitive and responsive UI for a smooth user experience**  

To enhance the application's capabilities, I have also implemented **additional backend features**, including **recipe deletion, updates, searching, and category-based filtering**. However, due to time constraints, the frontend currently does not integrate these advanced backend functionalities. Similarly, the **drag-and-drop feature** for organizing recipes is planned but remains incomplete.  

Despite these limitations, the app is **fully functional, efficient, and designed with future scalability in mind**.
